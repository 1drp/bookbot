# bookbot
Bookbot guided project from boot.dev

This bookbot counts the words and the occurances of each letter in Project Gutenberg's copy of Frankenstein.

There are absolutely efficiency improvements to be made.
Nice to have: ability to call the bookbot with a path to a text file to generate the report on any text file.

Ultimately, this is a learning project, and these changes will probably never be made.
